# Grid Views and Grid Control's View Repository


<p>This sample demonstrates the basics of working with Views. The application features a grid control that can display the same data using three different views - LayoutView, GridView and AdvBandedGridView. The currently active View can be specified manually or automatically (depending on the GridControl's current width). You can also toggle the active View's footer visibility, which demonstrates how to write common code for different View types with a common ancestor. </p><p>By studying this sample application you will learn how to create Views and add them to the GridControl's View Repository, obtain the list of all available Views, get or set the currently active View, perform specific action when the active View changes, write common code for different View types.<br />
